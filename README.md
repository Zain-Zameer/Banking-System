# Banking-System
Hey, I Created a Banking system in which you can operate all the operations that are available in real-time bank. :)

In that bank you can create account, use ATM, Exchange Currency, Send Money, Recieve Money or admin mode where you can see who have their accounts at our bank.

DEMO ACCOUNT:
for demo purpose I added my friend's account named Okasha Nadeem, His account Pincode is 6969. You can directly use atm, send or reciecve money & exchange currency.

Fun Fact: He told me to add 1M to his account haha :), So I did.

On Recieve Money Section You can take only 10000 rupees because thats what happens in real world you can accept only amount from that account which he/she allowed you to recieve.
Demo accounts to send or recieve money you can use "123456789" as demo account number.

On Admin Mode you can enter any key username and password only "2121" and then you can see your staff and public who have accounts in our bank.Just like little database.

CREATE ACCOUNT: 
On create account section, first you have to enter name if that name registered in our bank it shows it already registered or created.But if you dont have account it will tell you to create your account and enter your name,address letters only,date of birth in letters only,Nic Number,Phone Number and then you have to set your pincode only 4 digits.
Now you have account in our bank and also 5000 rupees gift from our bank in your account.



YOU CAN ALSO PAY FEES OF COLLEGE/UNIVERSITY IN BANK , JUST LIKE REAL-TIME!

Thank You :)
